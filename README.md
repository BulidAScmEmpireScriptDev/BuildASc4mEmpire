## 🔍 Behind the Script: How It Works

The script utilizes Roblox's `RemoteEvents` and `ReplicatedStorage` architecture to trigger in-game functions without modifying the core server code. Lua functions like `FireServer()` simulate player interactions that normally require manual clicking or grinding.

> Example:
```lua
replicatedStorage.RemoteEvents.CollectEarnings:FireServer()
```

This allows automation of:
- Earnings collection
- Unlocks
- Cash injections
